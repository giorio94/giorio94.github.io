                                Several emerging classes of interactive applications are demanding for extremely low-latency to be fully unleashed, with edge computing generally regarded as a key enabler thanks to reduced delays. This paper presents the outcome of a large-scale end-to-end measurement campaign focusing on task-offloading scenarios, showing that moving the computation closer to the end-users, alone, may turn out not to be enough. Indeed, the complexity associated with modern networks, both at the access and in the core, the behavior of the protocols at different levels of the stack, as well as the orchestration platforms used in data-centers hide a set of pitfalls potentially reverting the benefits introduced by low propagation delays. In short, we highlight how ensuring good QoS to latency-sensitive applications is definitely a multi-dimensional problem, requiring to cope with a great deal of customization and cooperation to get the best from the underlying network.

                                The capability to predict the precise resource requirements of a microservice-based application is a very important problem for cloud services. In fact, the allocation of abundant resources guarantees an excellent quality of experience (QoE) for the hosted services, but it can translate into unnecessary costs for the cloud customer due to the reserved (but unused) resources. On the other side, poor resource provisioning may turn out in scarce performance when experiencing an unexpected peak of demand. This paper proposes RAYGO, a novel approach for dynamic resource provisioning to microservices in Kubernetes that (i) reliefs the customers from the definition of appropriate execution boundaries, (ii) ensures the right amount of resources at any time, according to the past and the predicted usage, and (iii) operates at the application level, acknowledging the dependency between multiple correlated microservices.

                                Although high-speed in-vehicle networks are being increasingly adopted by the industry to support emerging use cases, previous research already demonstrated that car hacking is a real threat. This paper formalizes a novel framework proposed to provide improved security to the emerging SOME/IP middleware, without introducing at the same time limitations in the communication patterns available. Most notably, the entire traffic matrix is designed to be configured using simple high-level rules, clearly stating who can talk to whom according to the service abstraction adopted by SOME/IP. Three incremental security levels are made available, accounting for different services being associated with different requirements. The core security protocol, encompassing a session establishment phase followed by the transmission of secured SOME/IP messages, has been formally verified, to prove its correctness in terms of authentication and secrecy properties. Performance-wise, in-depth experimental evaluations conducted with an extended version of vsomeip confirmed the introduction of quite limited penalties compared to the bare unsecured implementation.

                                The coronavirus pandemic hit the entire education sector hard. All students were sent home and lectures started to be delivered through video-conferencing systems. CrownLabs is an open-source project providing an answer to the problem of delivering remote computing laboratories. Simplicity is one of its main characteristics, requiring nothing but a simple web browser to interact with the system and being all heavyweight computations performed at the university premises. Cooperation and mentoring are also encouraged through parallel access to the same remote desktop. The entire system is built up using components from the Kubernetes ecosystem, to replicate a “cloud grade” infrastructure, coupled with custom software implementing the core business logic. To this end, most of the complexity has been delegated to the infrastructure, to speed up the development process and reduce the maintenance burden. An extensive evaluation has been performed in both real and simulated scenarios to validate the overall performance: the results are encouraging, as well as the feedback from the early adopters of the system.

                                With every generation, vehicles are becoming smarter and more oriented toward information and communications technology (ICT). However, computerization is posing unforeseen challenges in a sector for which the first goal must be safety: car hacking has been shown to be a real threat. This article presents a novel mechanism to provide improved security for applications executed in the vehicle based on the principle of defining exactly who can talk to whom. The proposed security framework targets Ethernet-based communications and is tightly integrated within the emerging Scalable service-Oriented MiddlewarE over IP (SOME/IP) middleware. No complex configurations are needed: simple high-level rules, clearly stating the communications allowed, are the only element required to enable the security features. The designed solution has been implemented as a proof of concept (PoC) inside the vsomeip stack to evaluate the validity of the approach proposed: experimental measurements confirm that the additional overhead introduced in end-to-end communication is negligible.

                                Although vehicle platooning promises to improve transportation efficiency and safety by leveraging communication between convoy members, preliminary results in previous work suggest that cyber-attacks could deceive many Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control algorithms, hence endangering the safety of every participant. This paper deeply analyzes the case of injection attacks. First, we introduce an extensive security analysis carried out through realistic simulations, to demonstrate how even slight and smooth falsification attacks do succeed in fooling the CACC controllers and cause numerous vehicle crashes. Second, we present a novel misbehavior detection technique. It leverages the correlation between multiple motion parameters concerning both single and consecutive vehicles to evaluate the plausibility of the information received from the other members. Extensive validation confirms the effectiveness of the technique proposed: overall, it succeeds to detect all the attacks simulated and prevents the occurrence of safety-critical situations.
